# Comparison_Study_UDP_TCP

Introduction:

1. Socket programming is used mainly to handle low-level network 
applications in Java. TCP and UDP mainly provide the means to 
communicate between hosts through stream sockets and datagram sockets, 
respectively. It is a programming interface and communication endpoint 
that is used for connecting to other computers, sending, and receiving data 
from them.

2. TCP properties: reliable, connection-oriented, byte-stream, connection 
established before application-level protocols exchange information, twoway communication.

3. UDP properties: unreliable, packet-switched, packet data, no connection 
overhead, application-level protocols exchange information immediately, 
two-way communication.

A socket connection is a 4-tuple -- (HostA, PortA, HostB, PortB) -- uniquely 
defining the connection.

Discussion:

There are two separate folders for TCP and UDP. You can view both the folders for detailed understanding of each of these. The client and server codes are present in each of the folders. The programming language applied here is Java.

Conclusion:

In the end we get to know that:

- TCP- Transmission control protocol
- Two-way communication using TCP protocol.
- UDP- User Datagram Protocol
- Two-way communication using UDP protocol.
- Comparison between TCP and UDP.
- Understanding properties of both protocols in Packet Tracker.
  
Two main outcomes: 

- The packet loss takes place in UDP and not TCP.
- UDP is faster than TCP

Happy Learning!!
